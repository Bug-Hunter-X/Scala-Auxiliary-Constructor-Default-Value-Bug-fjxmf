```scala
class MyClass(val x: Int) {
  def this() = this(0) // Auxiliary constructor
}
```
In this seemingly simple Scala code, a subtle bug can arise if you are not careful about default values and the way auxiliary constructors work.  If the primary constructor (`this(x: Int)`) depends on the value of `x`, and the auxiliary constructor (`this()`) doesn't explicitly provide a valid value, the value of `x` in the primary constructor might end up being undefined, or it might inherit a value from a higher scope, leading to unexpected behavior or errors depending on the context. For instance, in some cases `x` will be 0, while in other cases its initial value might be undefined or some garbage value.
